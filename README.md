# Email Spam Classification ML Project

# Description
This project involves building and evaluating a machine-learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. The objective is to develop a robust spam detection system to identify and filter out unwanted emails accurately. The project uses machine-learning techniques and libraries to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

#Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the email dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from the email text.

Model Training: Training various machine learning models to classify emails.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
